# ðŸ‘‹  Hello

### My name is Blyzniuk Yevhen and I am from Kyiv, Ukraine.

I am Full Stack Web Developer for the last two years. 
My key technologies are :diamonds:Angular and :musical_score:Symfony.

Among that couple, I'm fairly often using other concepts, languages and tools:

- :star: JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP 
- :eyes: RxJs, NestJS, REST API
- :art: HTML, CSS, Scss, Angular-Material
- :floppy_disk: MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, Firebase Cloud Services
- :wrench: Webpack, Grunt, Composer, yarn, npm
- :ship: Docker, *-compose, terminal, bash 

and other useful things :zap:
